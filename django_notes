django notes : 

Model relationships

1. Parent table (Language), Child table (Framework) [The parent can have multiple childs but the clid can have only one parent] [put foreign key on child table]
	Single programming language can have multiple frameworks but framework is written in one language. 
	Python programmin language has multiple frameworks like unittest, django, flask etc. But django framework is written in only one language that is python.
